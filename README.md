# 🧠 Word Morph

**Word Morph** is a multilingual, memory-based word game where players try to recall a sequence of changing words. The challenge scales with difficulty — the faster and more accurately you recall, the higher your score!

This project was built using **React**, **JavaScript**, **Firebase**, and **CSS** as part of a UX course in Summer 2025, with a focus on game usability, multilingual support, and responsive design.

## 🎮 How It Works

1. **Choose a category** (Fruits, Animals, Objects currently available) and a difficulty level.
2. A sequence of words will appear one at a time — try to memorize them in the order shown!
3. Once the sequence ends, you'll be asked to recall each word in order.
4. Your **score** is based on recall accuracy and speed.
5. See if you can beat your **best score** (stored using Firebase Firestore)!

🗣️ Supports both **English** and **French**.
